# Prometheus + React demo

## How to run:

### On Machine:

> If you run into issues, make sure you're on current node LTS!

```bash
#Start Frontend
cd client
yarn install
yarn start

#Start API
cd server
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Docker

If you have docker installed, simply run:

`docker compose up -d`


After doing either of these, you should be able to navigate to `localhost:3000` and you'll see the app!
